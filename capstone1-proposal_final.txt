Capstone 1 Proposal- Crytocurrency Time Series Analysis with PythonINTROWe know cryptocurrency is one of the most volatile markets out there. Due to the instability, we hypothesized that using classical time series analysis (historical prices alone) isn’t the best way to predict a coin future price. Therefore, this project will use additional data such as correlation between the “cointegrated” coin and macroeconomic covariates to analyze the market, hoping that it will give us a better prediction of the future price. The project clients would be general investors who are interested in trading of cryptocurrencies. Clients will be able to predict the rise/fall of the price and, hypothetically, profit from trading the coins.    DATA SET (tentative)
Financial data available on Cryptocompare.com will be used for this project (link below). Price history of the following currencies will be used to identify the cointegrated pair: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin, Nem, Dash, ZCash, Monero, IOTA, Ethereum Classic, Nxt, StellarIn addition to the price history, this project will further explore additional features such as Google search counts of the word “cryptocurrency” (API link below), social media/news API’s, and Blockchain stats. METHOD (tentative)1. Identify macroeconomic covariates and obtain the data2. Identify cointegrated cryptocurrency pairs based on Granger Causality Test4. Based on 1,2 come up with a model that best predict the coin future priceDELIVERABLE (tentative)This project deliverable will be a blog post that describes the methodology and concludes the results.Links:Google Trends APIhttps://github.com/GeneralMills/pytrends/blob/master/README.md#api-methodsCryptocompare.com APIhttps://www.cryptocompare.com/api/#-api-data-histohour-
